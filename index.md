# Ariq's First CS193 Homework

- I like the learning environment in this class. It seems more laid-back than my other college classes which is a nice change of pace. I think I'll have a lot of fun in this class and I can't wait to see what more I'll learn.
- I like the teachers in this class. Although they're undergrads like me, I feel as though they know what they're doing and that they'll both be fun.
- I like the fact that I made my 1st friend in this class. My friend had two earlier classes with me but I didn't really talk to him much until this particular class where I finally made a new friend.
- I like the fact that we're forced to attend this class. I really don't like how attendance is optional for my other classes and I feel like attendance should be mandatory for all classes because I think it's easy to get distracted when you're simply watching a video online as opposed to actually being in class.
